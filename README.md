I’m Jennifer, thanks for visiting my profile.
Before joining the WBS Full-Stack Web & App Development course, my career was grounded in design and product development, backed by 25 years of professional work experience. Throughout my journey, I gained essential skills in communication, teamwork, organisation and problem-solving, attributes that I carry forward to my new career in software development.

I've had the privilege of designing products that found success in markets spanning the US and Europe. Notably, I contributed to the creation of a product that significantly boosted sales through repeat purchases, a testament to the impact of my design work.

My motivation to transition into coding came from a desire to go beyond designing digital products. I wanted to understand and be part of the process of building these products from the ground up. My interest in coding lies in its ability to transform technical expertise into beautiful, solution-driven products that tackle contemporary challenges.

During my time at WBS, I immersed myself in a variety of languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I embarked on both group and individual projects, such as crafting an interactive cookbook, to-do lists, blog sites, and delved into the intricacies of working with databases.

Looking ahead to my graduation from WBS in November 2023, my career goals revolve around combining my design & UI skills with coding. My goal is to become a Full-Stack Web & App Developer for organisations dedicated to causes close to my heart, including those that support animals, the environment, people, businesses or heritage preservation. I aspire to contribute my skills and experience to a nurturing and supportive work environment that values individuality.

In my free time, I love visiting museums and thinking about how those who came before us lived.
I also enjoy adding to my library of historical fashion books.
